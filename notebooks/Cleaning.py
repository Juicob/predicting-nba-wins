# consider grouping game details metrics for [these values](https://i.imgur.com/WqiiDfg.png) and also adding to main table
# 
# - group by game id (and team_id?????) to create columns for both maybe thisll work
#     - [reference](https://jamesrledoux.com/code/group-by-aggregate-pandas)
#     - details_df.groupby(['game_id', 'team_id'])                                            #.agg({'Age': ['mean', 'min', 'max']}) - multi aggregation optino - I think this might be tedious for my case with so many features. Instead I'll try to do one df for sum and another for mean and grab what I need from each
#         - sum_details_df = details_df.groupby(['game_id', 'team_id']).sum()
#         - mean_details_df = details_df.groupby(['game_id', 'team_id']).mean()
#     - may need to do something about indexes, either reset or move shit around so I can make the join
#     - home team
#         - sum of fga - field goal attempts to understand context as denominator
#         - mean fielg goal pct
#         - sum of free throw attempts for context
#         - mean free throw pct
#         - sum of three point shot attempts - context
#         - sum of off rebound
#         - sum of def rebound
#         - sum of steals
#         - sum of blocks
#         - sum of turn overs
#         - sum of personal fouls
#         - max points??? to show the highest single player point contributer?
#         - max assist??? to show the highest single player assist contributer?

# https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/
# 
# consider grouping modern and historical estimates of raptor metrics for average by team and joining home and away metrics to main table
# 
# - "RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his teamâ€™s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player"
# - "RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates"
# - "RAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played in a season"
